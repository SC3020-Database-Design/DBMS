# DBMS Design
## On Disk
  Note: Given the project requirements has to do with only the Storage and Indexing parts of a DBMS, the design uses a simplified design that tries to inherit some of the best practices that are used in practice for actual RDBMS, and may not handle some of the other requirements of DBMS like concurrency control, transaction isolation, and crash recovery.

  ### Specifications
  - Disk is just a byte[]. However we can think of it as having many Blocks
  - A block is a logical unit representing some slice of the Disk.
  - Each block is 200 Bytes
  - Each block has a 4 Byte block header containing an integer = # of records in the block currently
  - Each block can hold a maximum of 9 Records
  - Each Record is 24 Bytes = 2 Byte header + 2 Byte padding + 10 Byte String + 2 Byte padding + 4 Byte Float + 4 Byte Integer
  - Each record header contains a short = 0/1, which indicates whether a record is a tombstone(see below)
  - On disk we are representing data as an append-only log to utilize sequential writes for better performance. To prevent out-of-memory issues we will run a compaction process when the size of data is 90% of the limit(500mb)

  ### Insert/Delete/Update/Read
  - Inserting records are append-only to make use of sequential writes. To ensure that a lookup of a record is log(n) and not O(n) we create a default B tree index on the primary key(which is what real RDBMS do in practice)
  - Deleting records will not be executed immediately. Instead a 'tombstone'(borrowed term from distributed systems) will be appended(and the index's record pointer will point to this tombstone).
  - Updating records are essentially delete + insert. A tombstone displaces the original record. Then the updated record is appended at the end to make use of sequential writes. Finally, the index structure is updated to hold the new (block #, record # in block). 
  - Reading records by primary key involve retrieving the (block #, record # in block) from the default B tree. If it's a miss or the lookup is done on a non-primary column then a sequential O(n) look up is executed.
